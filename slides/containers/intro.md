## A brief introduction

- This was initially written to support in-person, instructor-led workshops and tutorials

- These materials are maintained by [Jérôme Petazzoni](https://twitter.com/jpetazzo) and [multiple contributors](https://@@GITREPO@@/graphs/contributors) to include [LearningVoyage.com](http://www.LearningVoyage.com)

- You can also follow along on your own, at your own pace

- We included as much information as possible in these slides

- We recommend having an Instructor to help you ...

- ... Or be comfortable spending some time reading the Docker
 [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) ...

- ... And looking for answers in the [Docker forums](forums.docker.com),
  [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/docker),
  and other outlets

class: self-paced or Instructor Led

## Hands on, you shall practice

- Nobody ever became a Jedi by spending their lives reading Wookiepedia

- Likewise, it will take more than merely *reading* these slides
  to make you an expert

- These slides include *tons* of exercises and examples

- They assume that you have access to a machine running Docker

- If you are attending a LearningVoyage Class:
  <br/>you will be given specific instructions to access a cloud VM
