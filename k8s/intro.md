## A brief introduction

- This was initially written by [Jérôme Petazzoni](https://twitter.com/jpetazzo) and was forked by [LearningVoyage.com](http://www.LearningVoyage.com) as a foundational course for microservices.
  
- Credit is also due to [multiple contributors](https://@@GITREPO@@/graphs/contributors) — thank you!

- You can also follow along on your own, at your own pace

- We included as much information as possible in these slides

- We recommend having a mentor to help you ...

- ... Or be comfortable spending some time reading the Kubernetes [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/) ...

- ... And looking for answers on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kubernetes) and other outlets

class: self-paced

## Hands on, you shall practice

- I hated every minute of training, but I said, 'Don't quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion.' Muhammad Ali

- Likewise, it will take more than following along with the Instructor
  to make you an expert

- These slides include *tons* of exercises and examples

- They assume that you have access to a Kubernetes cluster

- If you are attending a workshop or tutorial:
  <br/>you will be given specific instructions to access your cluster

- If you are doing this on your own:
  <br/>the first chapter will give you various options to get your own cluster
